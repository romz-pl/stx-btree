--- Summary ---

This directory contains a set of speed tests programs, which can be used to
compare the performance of different map containers.

The speedtest is compiled when ./configure is called with --enable-speedtest,
also add --enable-optimize!

Running the speedtest creates files like speed-set-all.txt and similar.

For gnuplot processing, the output files have to be transposed using the
transpose.awk:
$ for f in *.txt; do ./transpose.awk < $f > ${f%%.txt}.trt; done

Then pick out the latest gnuplot script from the results directories and run
it using the new result files.
